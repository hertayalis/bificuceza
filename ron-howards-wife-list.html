Pisces, as the final sign, has absorbed every lesson taught by the preceding signs, including the pleasures and sorrows, hopes and anxieties. It is represented as two fish swimming in opposite directions, symbolizing Pisces' continual divide of attention between imagination and reality.</p><p>Director, producer, and actor who first became known as Andy Griffith’s son Opie on The Andy Griffith Show and also played teenager Richie Cunningham on Happy Days.
