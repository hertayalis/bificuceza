And with Liz Woods’ help, he’s becoming a much softer, sweeter version of himself.</p><p>Hopefully, all this effort will pay off for Liz, who has put up with some seriously terrible treatment from Ed over the years.</p><p>But at least for now, Ed says he’s changed a lot, and now, he’s opening up about it.</p><p>“I haven’t changed one thing about Liz I admire,” he explained to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a>.</p><p>“She’s never broken up with me. And she’s never given up on me and I came out of, like, a 29-year, you know, not dating anybody. I didn’t really know how to be a boyfriend and I went and started to get therapy, and the therapist mentioned 15 co-dependencies. I think I had 14 of them. But Liz really kind of, in a way trained me on how to, you know, become a boyfriend.”</p><p>Big Ed went on to explain that the biggest issue that he had to fix was within himself. “I’m realizing that in life, if you’re not&nbsp;happy within yourself&nbsp;— which I haven’t been for a while — you can’t make the other person happy,” he explained.</p><p>Now, Big Ed is doing thoughtful things for Liz, like making her coffee, rubbing her feet, and even drawing her a bath after a long day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-big-ed-and-liz-woods-on-90-day-the-last-resort>Big Ed and Liz Woods on 90 Day: The Last Resort</h2><p>90 Day Fiance fans will get to see if Big Ed has really changed or if it’s all for show when the latest 90 Day Fiance spinoff kicks off this week.</p><p>Big Ed and Liz are one of five couples headed to a Florida resort for 90 Day: The Last Resort, where they will have a chance to work out their relationships and try to stay together with the help of therapy and each other.</p><p>It all starts on Monday, August 14, with an episode titled The Last Chance and is already proving to be quite explosive as spoilers for the upcoming spinoff claim that <a href=#>Jovi threatens to punch Big Ed</a> at some point.</p><p>It’s no secret that Jovi is not a fan of Liz’s man after the Tell All drama we saw much earlier this year, so putting them back together at the same resort <a href=#>along with Angela Deem</a> should prove to be an interesting watch.</p><p>90 Day: The Last Resort airs on Mondays at 9/8c on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5KetG6xw2aZq6eno3q0rdisZKWhqmLEsLvDrGStqpGeu6awjKGgpmWkpHqjsYyaZJudpKmys3nBqLCfqpmau6V5wKGcmpxdpLNuhY9mm5qxXam1pnnLmqqtZaKawLC%2B02g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eustace-conway.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eustace Conway</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1500-kg-to-lbs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>1500 kg to lbs - 1500 kilograms to pounds Conversion by NCESC</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-michelle-obama-file-for-divorce.html>Barack and Michelle Obama's Marriage Is Being Dragged Through the Mud, and We Won't Allow It!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ella-anderson-net-worth-142333.html>Ella Anderson Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./43369-kush-kelz-illest-nigga-ever-feat-ab-soul-new-song.html>Illest N*gga Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-lennon-net-worth-156902.html>John Lennon Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./justin-roilands-net-worth-explained-how-much-roiland-made-from-rick-and-morty-and-more.html>Justin Roilands net worth explained: How much Roiland made from Rick and Morty and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapJolt.
