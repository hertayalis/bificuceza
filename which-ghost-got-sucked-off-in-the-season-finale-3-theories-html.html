In the final moments of the season, viewers watched one of the beloved ghosts get “sucked off,” but they did not find out which one it was. It’ll be some time before season 3 airs, and we learn the fate of the <a href=#>Woodstone Mansion</a> ghosts. Until then, we have a few theories about which one might have been taken to the afterlife.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sam-and-Jay-what-a-ghost-get-sucked-off-1.jpg><h2>One of the basement ghosts might have been ‘sucked off’&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-2_36>One&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>&nbsp;user pointed out that one of the basement ghosts had decidedly more screentime in season 2 than in season 1. The ghost, Nancy, is the cholera ghost who seemed the least satisfied with her basement situation.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_45>Following several visits upstairs, we can’t help but wonder if the ghost is going to be granted her freedom after spending nearly two centuries in the dingy basement of Woodstone Mansion. There isn’t much evidence to back up the theory, but it’s one we like.&nbsp;</p><h2>Viewers theorize that Stephanie’s time at Woodstone Mansion might be over&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-4_78>If one of the nameless basement ghosts wasn’t <a href=#>sucked off</a>, fans are banking on Stephanie, the teenage attic ghost being the one who moved on to the next realm. Stephanie, a mean girl in life, was unhappy at Woodstone Mansion when she was first introduced. In season 2, she found love with one of the basement ghosts and was decidedly more pleasant. That may be all it took to get the ax murder victim to the other side.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_57>The placement of the blinding light in the final moments of season 2 of&nbsp;Ghosts&nbsp;feels like a clue. Some fans believe that Stephanie may have been the ghost that has finally found her way to the afterlife because the light was positioned over the attic. Stephanie lived her ghostly existence in the mostly unused portion of the mansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-alberta-or-nigel-are-the-most-likely-options-for-a-prominent-ghost-getting-sucked-off>Alberta or Nigel are the most likely options for a prominent ghost getting ‘sucked off’&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-6_56>Alberta Haynes and Nigel Chessum are two popular ghosts, with Alberta residing in the main mansion and Nigel spending much of his time with his British troops in the mansion’s shed. While both spirits are popular with fans, their season 2 storylines have come full circle, creating a path for either ghost to be sucked off.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ghosts-season-2-finale-group-shot.jpg><p id=par-7_61>Nigel and Issac’s relationship has progressed, and Nigel has accepted <a href=#>his death</a> at the hands of his now love. The duo have spent years liking each other from afar. His death and unrequited feelings for Issac may have been the unfinished business keeping him tied to Woodstone Mansion. With those issues resolved, his path should be clear to be sucked off.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_101>Alberta also has answers to questions that plagued her throughout her time at Woodstone Mansion. Alberta learned that she was, in fact, murdered and that Hetty’s son was her murderer. During the tail end of season 2, Alberta also discovered that her sister did not betray her. With all of her questions answered, there is really no reason for Alberta to remain at Woodstone. Aside from the sheer popularity of the character, that is. It’s possible Alberta was the ghost that was sucked off. Still, we don’t think this theory is likely. It would be the most emotionally trying option, though.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_20>CBS has not announced an official premiere date for <a href=#>season 3</a>. We assume it will be back in the fall.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqbXCoWSgoJ%2BowW6zzq1krK2ToLKlec6fnWahnmLBqbGMrJyaq5%2Bjeqe1zZqjnmVjYsGpsc6roJ6rXp3BrriO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lenovo-launches-loq-tower-17irb8-an-affordable-prebuilt-with-intel-13th-gen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>An Affordable Pre-Built With Intel 13th Gen</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-gen-1-moving-to-tsmc-for-more-speed-lower-power.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Moving to TSMC for More Speed, Lower Power</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-michelle-obama-file-for-divorce.html>Barack and Michelle Obama's Marriage Is Being Dragged Through the Mud, and We Won't Allow It!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ella-anderson-net-worth-142333.html>Ella Anderson Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./43369-kush-kelz-illest-nigga-ever-feat-ab-soul-new-song.html>Illest N*gga Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-lennon-net-worth-156902.html>John Lennon Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./justin-roilands-net-worth-explained-how-much-roiland-made-from-rick-and-morty-and-more.html>Justin Roilands net worth explained: How much Roiland made from Rick and Morty and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapJolt.
