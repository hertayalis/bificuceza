She was born under the Zodiac sign Virgo on 31 August 1979, in Puerto Rico, the USA; she’s Cuban-American, even though she was born in Puerto Rico. As of 2021, she is 42 years old, and is currently residing in Los Angeles with her husband.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_Family>Early life and Family</span></h2><p>Not much is known about her family and early life. Yara&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>was raised</a>&nbsp;in Miami alongside her two siblings. Considering that she is the grandniece of Alicia Alonso, the famous Cuban prima ballerina who founded Cuba’s National Ballet, it is logical to imply that dancing is one of her strongest suits.</p><p>From an early age, she was directed by her parents to take up ballet, and so enrolled at a ballet school in Miami, which she described as “very strict”. She spent ten years training as a ballerina, but later, after attending a summer dance program with acting classes, she shifted her focus. In her interview with the Galo Magazine, she disclosed: “What I liked was playing the classical parts in ballet because of the characters. When I took that acting class, I realized I wanted to be an actress. So, it was through dance that I found that.”</p><p>Regarding her education, Yara studied at the New York-based New World School of Arts. After obtaining her diploma, she remained in New York, where she toiled as a cocktail waitress, simultaneously trying to find a talent agent.</p><p>However, Yara soon realized that it was not as easy as she had hoped it would be, and driven by her displeasure with waiting tables, she moved to Los Angles to hopefully pursue a career as a TV and movie actress.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Yara’s career was&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>launched</a>&nbsp;at the age of 22, in an episode of the hit series “Sex and The City.

Additionally, she was featured as Mariella Moretta in the crime drama series “Southland”, appearing in a total of seven episodes.</p><p>In 2010 she made one-episode appearances in the police procedural TV series “CSI: NY”, and “Chase”, and also portrayed Molly in the TV movie “A Walk in My Shoes”.

The show aired from June to October 2012, being criticised for the played-out plot, which oddly resembled older soap operas such as “The City” and “The Hills”; it was canceled after the first season.</p><p>During the same year, Yara was cast as attorney Theresa Lopez, in the teen&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>mystery drama </a>entitled “The Lying Game”. Developed by Charles Pratt, the series received generally favorable reviews, and ran for two seasons, it later becoming known that the network cancelled the show.</p><p>In 2013 she starred as Adriana de Portago, one of the show’s regular roles in the political satire streaming series “Alpha House”, garnering success. The series received mixed reviews, but was renewed for a second season, after which it was canceled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thebiography.org///thebiography.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/yara-martinez-2016-elton-john-academy-awards-viewing-party-1-678x1024.jpg><p>The following year, she mainly landed one-episode roles in series such as “Hawaii Five-O” and “Necessary Roughness”, then in 2014, she was cast as Dr. Luisa Alver in the popular drama series “Jane the Virgin” opposite Gina Rodriguez and Andrea Navedo. The show swept both the audiences and critics, receiving overwhelmingly positive reviews, and numerous nominations and wins. It ran for eight seasons, earning the title as one of the top 10 TV programs of 2014.</p><p>Yara was also cast in the ever-popular&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>crime series</a>&nbsp;“True Detective”, starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.

They initially announced their engagement via social media in 2016, Yara posting a photo of her lavish engagement ring on her Instagram, with captions: “Gonna marry this man”. Two years later, the couple crowned their long-term relationship with marriage on 6 March.</p><h2><span id=Briefly_about_Joe_Lewis>Briefly about Joe Lewis</span></h2><p>Not to be confused with Joe Lewis the businessman, mogul, and major owner of Tottenham Hotspur football club, or Joe Lewis, the kick-boxer and martial&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>artist</a>, Yara’s husband, Joe Lewis, is a TV producer.</p><p>He came into public focus as the head of the Original Programming at the retail giant and streaming outlet, Amazon Studios. In 2017, Joe <a rel=nofollow href=#>departed</a> from the company after chief Roy Price resign following sexual harassment accusations.</p><p>Joe is known for numerous successful projects, such as the series’ “FleaBag”, “Too Old to Die Young”, and “Transparent”, for which he was the executive producer. In 2019, Joe won the Prime Time Emmy Award in the category Outstanding Comedy Series, and a PGA Award for the Outstanding Producer for the comedy series “Fleabag”. According to his Linkedin&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>profile</a>, he has been working at Amplify Pictures as CEO, head of television, since January 2018.

Her natural hair is brown, while her eyes are also brown. Considering that most of her roles in crime and police series call for certain physical readiness, it doesn’t surprise that Yara has maintained her fit body shape throughout the years.</p><p>When it comes to her hobbies, she likes to watch series and movies in her free time. In an interview, she&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>said</a>: “What is cool is that by my house, there are a lot of little movie theaters.</p><p>We like to go to a silent movie theatre. This month they are showing some French films from the ’60s and ’70s. We will go with some friends to dinner, take a bottle of wine and to watch French films”.</p><p>Yara also disclosed that she prefers working for online shows rather than network series. She <a rel=nofollow href=#>explained</a>: “The main difference between network TV and here, is the nucleus of people involved is a lot smaller. It allows for more creative freedom for the writer and me, because there aren’t a lot of people to report to.”</p><h2><span id=Is_she_active_on_social_media>Is she active on social media?</span></h2><p>Yara is active on her social media – her Instagram&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>account</a>&nbsp;has over 200,000 followers, while her&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Twitter</a> counts nearly 30,000.
