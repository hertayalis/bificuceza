Additionally, Punk has been spotted at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, where he has reportedly been helping out.</p><p>During a recent <a href=#>Wrestling Perspective Podcast</a>, Punk’s close friend Ace Steel mentioned that WWE is interested in having Punk on commentary.</p><p>When asked about a possible role for Punk on WWE TV until he returns to in-ring action, Steel responded, “Definitely, they want him on commentary.” He expressed some reservations about Punk being in an onscreen role, especially if he were on the same show as Drew McIntyre, as Punk’s focus might shift towards a potential rivalry with McIntyre.</p><p>“I don’t know that they go that route since they did an injury angle to pull him out since they did the storyline on him; [Drew] stomps on his arm. There’s the physicality that puts him out. I personally don’t want to see him in an onscreen role unless it’s in the meantime he’s doing NXT or something.”</p><p>“I really don’t want to see him on the same show as Drew Mcintyre because his sole focus would be going after Drew Mcintyre. “Well, I can’t fight you. Well, I’m gonna try.”</p><p>“We see people hit by cars and forktrucks and all these things, you know. Still, I feel like the fact that they did the injury that a lot of people think they, they put the storyline to it now that a lot of people think it’s, he’s faking it, which is hilarious that it’s a storyline 100% which of course it’s wrestling. So, you’ve done so many of those, like, oh, well, let’s do this where he hurts guys.”</p><p>It’s worth noting that WWE often explores various roles for talent, and Punk’s potential involvement on commentary could be an intriguing addition to WWE programming if it comes to fruition. However, fans will have to wait for an official announcement or confirmation from WWE to see if CM Punk will indeed take up a commentary role during his recovery period.</p><p>Would you like to see CM Punk work as a commentator for WWE while he’s sidelined?
