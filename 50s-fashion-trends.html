In response to the end of World War II, designers embraced newfound larger fabric quantities and carved out a new silhouette. <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Christian Dior</a> was at the helm of this movement, and the result was flouncy, wide-circle skirts with narrow, nipped-in waists.&nbsp;</p><p id=e8WsxE2R7N data-wc=57>In London, the Teddy Boy look emerged for teenagers and young adults, intrinsically linked to the subculture. Vilified by the papers, these rock 'n' roll obsessives had a reputation for hooliganism and bad behaviour. The look consisted of drape jackets, richly reminiscent of 1940s American zoot suits, styled alongside drainpipe trousers with exposed socks and slick quiffs.</p><p id=eX1GFY4xuM data-wc=14>Wanting to infuse your current wardrobe with a splash of vintage elegance?

Fashion</a><strong>&nbsp;shares the 1950s fashion trends that ruled the decade:</strong></p><h2><strong>Wide skirts</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/b2f0b527d055-grace-kelly.jpg><h3>The trend</h3><p id=eHMWr6HEd8p data-wc=58>Celebrating the end of wartime fabric shortages, Christian Dior orchestrated a bold new silhouette with his now-iconic 'New Look'. An indulgent wide-shape skirt enchanted women across the globe, and revolutionised traditional approaches towards feminine silhouettes. While the style is less commonplace today, it is still often used in celebrity red carpet looks to serve a certain retro glamour.</p><p id=eFLmmvIIMRCL data-wc=12><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>The fashion trends from the 1960s that we still adore today</a></strong></p><h3 data-gid=ensMk3n8mNH>Style advice</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/f97304514129-dior-wide-skirt.jpg><p id=enSVGBKn3g data-wc=67>Crafted from camel gabardine, this piece pays homage to Dior's rich heritage with its elegant flared cut. But a two-tier composition allows it a certain contemporary cool, lending itself to the current <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>boho</a> revival. The weight of the fabric, in tandem with gathered detailing, gives structure, and the skirt would work well alongside a fitted square-neck top and a thick, equestrian-inspired belt to emphasise a cinched-in silhouette.</p><h2><strong>Cat-eye sunglasses</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/8f608e7cb700-woman-wearing-cat-eye-sunglasses.jpg><h3 data-gid=ezVZSAW8e_>The trend</h3><p id=eS2ixUXJDF1 data-wc=35>Sultry, feline-shaped <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>shades</a> first took off in the 1950s, and were often styled alongside elegant headscarves. Cat-eye sunglasses further skyrocketed in popularity the following decade thanks to OG cat-eye trendsetter Holly Golightly, aka Audrey Hepburn.</p><h3>Style advice</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/fc4dabbdf984-mango-cat-eye-sunglasses.jpg><p id=eRt2-V5JpPg data-wc=45>Upturned, cat-eye styles suit most face shapes, but work especially well on longer faces since they add width. These glossy acetate frames by Mango are created from recycled post-industrial waste and would work excellently alongside a cream wide-brimmed sun hat and a cheery out-of-office attitude.</p><h2><strong>Silk scarves</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/509e63311794-sophia-loren.jpg><h3 data-gid=ezVZSAW8e_>The trend</h3><p id=erFTi0f3ZbJ6 data-wc=41>Ah, the perennially chic silk scarf. Believe it or not, they're actually pretty difficult to pull off without veering into air hostess territory, and yet, somehow the 1950s starlets got it right every time. Your accessory arsenal is incomplete without one.</p><p id=eP8lB236-vII data-wc=12><strong>&nbsp;READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>1970s fashion trends that are having a major revival this season</a></strong></p><p id=e1sWlXwMCtHP data-wc=13><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>80s fashion for women: 6 incredible style moments we still love today</a></strong></p><h3 data-gid=ensMk3n8mNH>Style advice&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c9d795a12c00-liberty-silk-scarf.jpg><p id=eAhkPO77gi7 data-wc=57>Known for its superlative print designers, Liberty make the most exquisite silk scarves. Fusing retro flair with contemporary playfulness, this square peacock piece has a joyful eclecticism. Infinitely versatile, this scarf could adorn a printed top-handle bag, be wrapped around the hair like a bandana or be tied around the neck à la our vintage style icons.</p><h2><strong>High-waisted bikinis</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e45522c2bf50-marilyn-monroe.jpg><h3 data-gid=ezVZSAW8e_>The trend</h3><p id=eQ91HumQblXY data-wc=66>The modern bikini was born in 1946, and yet, the two-piece swimsuit flourished the following decade when glamour shots of popular actresses and models brought the style into the mainstream.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>After years of lying dormant, the swimwear style has come roaring back into fashion consciousness in the last decade with the likes of Arabella London, Dolce & Gabbana and Hunza G all championing chic high-waisted designs.</p><h3 data-gid=ensMk3n8mNH>Style advice&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/377126d42ddb-hunza-g-bikini.jpg><p id=e0EvC7GAN7 data-wc=49>Swimwear specialist Hunza G excels in poolside glam, and this bandeau bikini is currently sitting at the top of our holiday wish list. Created from the label's signature seersucker, the crinkled effect is extremely forgiving, the high-waisted cut flattering, and the rich, ruby shade has a certain classic charm.</p><h2><strong>Pencil skirts</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/cea93cfb59f2-1950s-woman-wearing-a-pencil-skirt.jpg><h3 data-gid=ezVZSAW8e_>The trend</h3><p id=exfVtliST49e data-wc=34>The pencil skirt came to define 1950s workwear, with revered designer Christian Dior creating his own version in his 1954 autumn/winter collection. Paired with fitted jackets or cropped cardigans, the style oozed unfussy sophistication.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-gid=ensMk3n8mNH>Style advice&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e87dc90a6399-zara-pencil-tie-dye-skirt.jpg><p id=eMg3KRvBJw data-wc=44>Thinking of rocking a pencil skirt in 2023?

Wanting to incorporate a spot of gingham into your wardrobe today? Look no further than Molly Goddard, Rouje and Shrimps.</p><h3 data-gid=ensMk3n8mNH>Style advice&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/83de2790aa53-rouje-gingham-dress.jpg><p id=eD9AEgqkAYi data-wc=45>Affordable designer label Rouje excels in chic, enduring silhouettes that, crucially, aren't bound to monotonous neutral colour palettes, unlike some of its more expensive counterparts. Rouje's Oriana dress, created from navy gingham cloqué, would look amazing styled with of-the-moment mules and a bold scarlet lip.</p><h2><strong>Hourglass silhouettes</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/9e85036a8f38-woman-with-an-hourglass-silhouette.jpg><h3 data-gid=ezVZSAW8e_>The trend</h3><p id=e4TxfQSfQytR data-wc=43>Defined by bust and hip measurements nearly equal in width, the hourglass shape was all the rage back then, often achieved via cinching belts that have the effect of a nipped-in waist. Our modern day hourglass icon? <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Kim Kardashian</a> with a capital 'K'.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-gid=ensMk3n8mNH>Style advice&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/2124557aab05-other-stories-belt.jpg><p id=eMNoQ2rg_G data-wc=45>High street belts can often look cheap and unappealing, but this thick black version by & Other Stories poses an unexpectedly stylish counterargument. Crafted from chrome-free leather and featuring gold chrome detailing, it would look great layered over a printed peasant dress to add structure.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Halter necklines</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/27c2ae92da69-elizabeth-taylor-halter-neck.jpg><h3 data-gid=ezVZSAW8e_>The trend</h3><p id=eqCodxsTsf_i data-wc=27>Still relevant in the popular Y2K crop styles of today, halter necklines were huge back then, within the context of swimwear as well as elegant evening dresses.</p><h3 data-gid=eQ8uxAHmVh>Style advice&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/418c31e69587-cos-halter-top.jpg><p id=er1xiFOtKMW data-wc=32>Does your <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>holiday</a> eveningwear need an upgrade? Consider Cos' pistachio hued halter top, crafted from a liquid-like Ecovero viscose blend. Team with white tailored trousers and minimalist metallic sandals for maximum impact.</p><h2>Gloves</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/43777db5c0ba-audrey-hepburn-wearing-gloves.jpg><h3 data-gid=ezVZSAW8e_>The trend</h3><p id=e6XTd8yXn5 data-wc=37>Gloves were strongly linked to etiquette, and upper class women wore them pretty much whenever they left the house. Shorter styles were appropriate for daywear, whereas longer, opera styles were deemed suitably glamorous for an evening affair.</p><h3 data-gid=eQ8uxAHmVh>Style advice&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d81c06254a69-the-row-gloves.jpg><p id=eU5EDieQNx data-wc=46>Check out Belgian label Dries van Noten for high drama opera gloves, but The Row's short crochet pair have caught our eye for a more relaxed, summery feel. Featuring ruffled cuffs and saccharine scalloped edging, these gloves are guaranteed to spark passionate conversations among accessory aficionados.</p><h2>Cuffed jeans&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/264797348f5a-woman-wearing-cuffed-jeans.jpg><h3 data-gid=ezVZSAW8e_>The trend</h3><p id=ejr_uD5OLZ data-wc=41>Originally designed for functional purposes, jeans had a moment in the 1950s, during which they crossed over into everyday wear. Hollywood heartthrobs Marlon Brando and James Dean popularised the turned-up look and teenagers followed suit, embracing cuffed jeans into their wardrobes.</p><h3 data-gid=eQ8uxAHmVh>Style advice&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/b557506e7fe3-boden-turned-up-jeans.jpg><p id=eW3pv2hfg3 data-wc=43>Boden's cuffed jeans look far more expensive than they actually are on account of the dark denim fabric and attention to detail in the topstitching finish. Team yours with a simple plain white tee and platform sneakers for a sense of casual cool.</p><h2>Cropped trousers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/cd33397296f1-dawn-addams-wearing-cropped-trousers.jpg><h3 data-gid=ezVZSAW8e_>The trend</h3><p id=etFAmbo1AKK data-wc=21>While dresses and skirts still dominated, ankle-grazing cigarette trousers and shorter capri styles trickled down to the masses via screen stars.</p><h3 data-gid=eQ8uxAHmVh>Style advice&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e80ad410aeda-s-max-mara-trousers.jpg><p id=eEkWHG-7ZM data-wc=60>Cropped trousers are actually quite a tricky trend to nail. Your best bet is to try on heaps of different styles until you find 'the one'. Graphic prints such as 'S Max Mara's Efeso design add interest, and this particular pair would look super flattering alongside minimalist mules to elongate the line of the leg if you have shorter calves.</p><p id=eZ6rZM7xOdip data-wc=21><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our Hello!
