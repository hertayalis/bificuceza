How is she still alive? Here's what we know about Kirby.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Dimension Films</span></figure><p>Fans of the <a href=#>Scream horror franchise</a> were delighted when the latest installment, titled simply <a href=#>Scream</a>, arrived in theaters on Jan. 14, 2022. Now, a follow-up to the film, Scream 6, is on its way, with a few familiar faces in the cast. One of those faces is Scream 4 character Kirby Reed, played by actress <a href=#>Hayden Panettiere</a>.</p><p>However, fans of Scream 4 will recall that Kirby's character wasn't exactly the final girl of the film. What happened to Kirby in Scream 4? Is her character still alive? Here's everything we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Dimension Films</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Kirby Reed in 'Scream 4'?</h2><p>Scream 4 follows a group of friends on the 16th anniversary of the original Woodsboro murders. When two friends, Jenny and Marnie, are murdered by Ghostface, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) becomes a suspect while she's in town promoting her book. Sidney's cousin, Jill (Emma Roberts), and her friends Olivia Morris (Marielle Jaffe) and Kirby Reed are all threatened via phone by Ghostface.</p><p>The town's sheriff, Dewey Riley (David Arquette), Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), and Sidney all work to uncover the identity of the copycat Ghostface killer, but before they can find out more information, there are several murders in quick succession.</p><p>When Jill goes to Kirby's house to visit, things quickly go awry, and Ghostface murders one of the partygoers. Charlie, a friend of Jill's who is a self-professed horror aficionado, is tied up, but when Kirby goes to free him, he stabs her, revealing himself as Ghostface.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Dimension Films</span></figure><p>It's later revealed that Jill was working in tandem with Charlie to frame their other friend Trevor for the murders. Jill was jealous of the attention her cousin Sidney received after she survived Ghostface the first time and was determined to re-create the scenario to become famous herself. However, her plan backfires, and after Jill kills Charlie, Sidney is forced to kill her to save Gale.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, did Kirby die in 'Scream 4'?</h2><p>Although Kirby is stabbed onscreen and left to die, both director Wes Craven and many fans argue she did not die. Reportedly, it was also in Hayden's contract that she could not die onscreen. The latest Scream film seemed to affirm fan theories of Kirby's survival when a thumbnail of Kirby giving an interview appeared in a scene, labeling her a "Woodsboro survivor."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Dimension Films</span></figure><p>On May 10, 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> announced that in addition to returning cast members Jenna Ortega, Melissa Barrera, Jasmin Savoy Brown, and Mason Gooding, the Scream franchise would see the return of Kirby at long last.</p><p>The few details Variety knows about the film are vague, but Scream 6 reportedly "follows the quartet as they leave Woodsboro behind and attempt to start a fresh chapter."</p><p>In the meantime, you can catch up on the Scream franchise. All the films are currently streaming on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSkoaKXxm6%2FwqucmqVdaQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-throwing-up-help-acid-reflux-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will Throwing Up Help Acid Reflux? - Exploring the Effectiveness of Vomiting as a Remedy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pokemon-go-should-you-get-the-spreading-cheer-community-day-special-research-ticket.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pokmon Go Spreading Cheer Community Day Special Research Ticket - Is it Worth it?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-michelle-obama-file-for-divorce.html>Barack and Michelle Obama's Marriage Is Being Dragged Through the Mud, and We Won't Allow It!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ella-anderson-net-worth-142333.html>Ella Anderson Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./43369-kush-kelz-illest-nigga-ever-feat-ab-soul-new-song.html>Illest N*gga Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-lennon-net-worth-156902.html>John Lennon Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./justin-roilands-net-worth-explained-how-much-roiland-made-from-rick-and-morty-and-more.html>Justin Roilands net worth explained: How much Roiland made from Rick and Morty and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapJolt.
