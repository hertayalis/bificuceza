He is known for his introspective songwriting and combination of hip-hop and R&B. Green rose to fame with the 2019 single "Heart on Ice", which went viral on YouTube and TikTok and peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. Green's debut album, Ghetto Gospel (2019), peaked at number 10 on the US Billboard 200. His second album, Pray 4 Love (2020), peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, and included his highest-charting song, "Rags2Riches."<p>Green was born on August 27, 1999, and raised in St. Petersburg, Florida. He was raised by his mother and father, who eventually separated while he attended elementary school. He began singing in the fifth grade. Green attended Lakewood High School, from which he graduated in 2017.</p><p>Green's career began in 2018. He released several mixtapes independently prior to signing with Alamo Records. On June 14, 2019, he released his mixtape PTSD, which included the song "Heart On Ice". The song went viral on YouTube and TikTok, peaking at number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. Green's debut album, Ghetto Gospel was released on November 1, 2019, and peaked at number 10 on the US Billboard 200.</p><p>Green's second album Pray 4 Love was released on April 3, 2020, debuting at number 2 on the Billboard 200, with a deluxe edition following on August 7. Several songs from the album charted on the Billboard Hot 100, including "Rags2Riches", which peaked at number 12 on the Hot 100 and became his highest-charting song. On August 11, 2020, Rod Wave was included in XXL's 2020 Freshman Class. He is currently working on his third, as yet untitled, album, which was originally set for release on August 27, 2020.</p><p>Blessed with a special singing voice, and the knowledge of how best to use it, Florida's Rod Wave is taking his own path to the top of the game. Coming through with a soulful set of Southern sing-raps, Rod has developed a groundswell of regional support through a prolific output that includes 3 projects in the last 12 months. After generating millions of streams with breakout singles “Heart On Ice” and “Popular Loner,” both off June 2019’s PTSD project, Rod levels up with Ghetto Gospel, his new project. With heavy use of organic instrumentation, including snaking electric guitars and warm organ swells, Ghetto Gospel gives a proper title to Rod's spiritual and nakedly-emotional blend of rap music, defined by Rod's unique singing ability, able to switch from a bluesy croon to rapid-fire triplets at a moments notice. Featuring the popular new single "Cuban Links," which features an appearance from Ghetto Gospel executive producer Kevin Gates, and the "Heart On Ice" (Remix), which features an appearance from Lil Durk, Ghetto Gospel is available everywhere.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifKK4wa6kaIqfmayYrdWeZoygn6TBqrrGmIqtmaI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stella-shanahan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stella Shanahan</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-pastorelli-net-worth-204727.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Pastorelli Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-michelle-obama-file-for-divorce.html>Barack and Michelle Obama's Marriage Is Being Dragged Through the Mud, and We Won't Allow It!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ella-anderson-net-worth-142333.html>Ella Anderson Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./43369-kush-kelz-illest-nigga-ever-feat-ab-soul-new-song.html>Illest N*gga Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-lennon-net-worth-156902.html>John Lennon Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./justin-roilands-net-worth-explained-how-much-roiland-made-from-rick-and-morty-and-more.html>Justin Roilands net worth explained: How much Roiland made from Rick and Morty and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapJolt.
