See, Jack grew up eating his Uncle Billy’s mashed potatoes, and he still reminisces about them. They were creamy, fluffy, and rich with (lots of) melted butter and (lots of) sour cream.&nbsp; These garlic mashed potatoes aren’t exactly like Uncle Billy’s.&nbsp;Instead of dairy, olive oil and starchy potato cooking water give them an amazing creamy texture, and roasted garlic fills them with rich, nutty depth of flavor.

My recipe comes together in 15 minutes, and it delivers rich flavor with just a few basic ingredients! I used Jack’s mom’s creamed spinach as a starting point for this recipe. She made it for Thanksgiving every year when Jack was growing up, and he still raves about it. In developing this recipe, I wanted to capture the luxurious flavor and silky texture of her creamed spinach while putting the fresh greens front and center. Many creamed spinach recipes use frozen…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Growing up, my favorite part of Thanksgiving was the pumpkin pie. All year, I’d look forward to that creamy, cinnamon-y, custardy filling. I loved pumpkin pie filling so much that I’d scoop it right out of its pie crust, leaving a triangle-shaped shell of pastry on my plate. I’d then pass it to my Dad (who ate everything my sister and I left behind), and ask for another slice. As an adult, I often opt for apple crisp because I don’t think Jack will eat all of my empty crusts (ok, actually, he might), but either way, that’s not an…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This sweet potato casserole recipe is one of my favorite Thanksgiving side dishes. I haven’t always been such a sweet potato casserole fan. When I was growing up, my family had sweet potato casserole with marshmallows every year, and I never loved it. For me, sweet potatoes plus sweet marshmallows is just too much sweet. But this sweet potato casserole recipe won me over. I swap out the mini marshmallows for a pecan crumble topping. It’s savory and crunchy—the perfect complement to the creamy sweet potatoes underneath. Make this recipe for a holiday meal, and I promise it will be…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Is there anything better than warm apple crisp baking in the oven? This easy apple crisp recipe is my go-to fall dessert. Not only is it a HUGE hit with our friends and family, but it’s also simple to make, it’s deliciously spiced, and it will make your kitchen smell amazing! The Best Apple Crisp Recipe I’ve made lots and lots of apple crisps in the past, but this one takes the cake… er… crisp. It starts with warm, stewed, soft apples – I cook them down with a little apple cider vinegar (or lemon juice!) for pop.

Once the temperature starts dropping, I start craving all sorts of cozy recipes. Lasagna, mac and cheese, eggplant Parmesan, you name it. But while I love all of those things, some nights I want to get my comfort food fix with as little work as possible. That’s where this easy vegetarian chili recipe comes in. Like any good veggie chili, it’s hearty, warming, smoky, and spicy. Made with a short list of pantry ingredients, it packs in a hefty amount of veggies, but it’s so yummy that even a meat…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>There are plenty of great reasons to know how to make pumpkin puree at home, even if you can find it in a can. Why make homemade pumpkin puree? You live in a country where pumpkin puree is not available in cans but you still want to partake in all of the yummy fall pumpkin recipes that are all around the internet and Instagram. You got overzealous at the farmers market because the pumpkin was so cute and fall looking, and you didn’t realize you’d have at least 20 pounds/9 kilos of squash to deal with.

While I’ve posted many hummus variations here on the blog and even more in my first cookbook, I’ve recently gotten requests for my go-to classic homemade hummus recipe. Even though I think it’s fun to mix veggies into all kinds of chickpea dips (see below for many of those options), this is the hummus recipe I make when I’m craving that classic tahini-forward, ultra-creamy, smooth dip, just like the kind I enjoy at a good Middle Eastern restaurant.

Both are warming, cozy, and healthy. But while making butternut squash soup might be one of my favorite Sunday activities, a baked sweet potato is my weeknight standby. They’re incredibly easy to make, as your oven does 95% of the work. While they bake, you’re free to do as you please! Prep the remaining components of your meal, finish up with the day’s work, or catch up with family or friends.

If you’re still looking for a really fun, delicious, and healthy(-ish!) main dish for your cookouts this weekend, this Cauliflower Po’ Boy Sandwich is just the thing for you! What is a po boy? A traditional sandwich from New Orleans, a po’ boy is typically served on French bread and stuffed with roast beef or fried seafood, oftentimes shrimp. A slather of creamy remoulade sauce ties the whole thing together.

We haven’t had success with everything we’ve tried raising (this year mint has been especially tricky), but our cherry tomato plants are going pretty well. We started them from transplants, and now they’re thriving in big pots ringed in by tomato cages. As each plant grows, it produces bright yellow, bite-sized summer treats (see our little homegrown yellow variety of cherry tomatoes in this post)!
