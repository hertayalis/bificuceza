If used in the right way, it could enhance — rather than replace — the human artists we love, starting with <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beanie Sigel</a></strong>.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>The 49-year-old rapper has collaborated with several of the industry greats, including Jay-Z and 50 Cent, and produced several studio albums in the 2000s and early 2010s. He faded from the spotlight over the last decade and a half, due to an accident that nearly took his life in 2014, and he’s using AI to help make his way back into the mainstream.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-to-beanie-sigel-s-voice data-injectable=false>What happened to Beanie Sigel’s voice?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Beanie Sigel (@beaniesigelsp)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>Sigel was among the wave of talented up-and-comers who hit the rap scene between 2000 and 2010, but his tenure in the spotlight was short-lived. He never quite managed to catch on like some of the greats, thanks to numerous run-ins with the law, time served, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">several accidents</a> — one of which nearly ended his career for good.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>That one came about in 2014 when Sigel was wounded in a drive-by shooting. After being rushed to the hospital, a portion of one of his lungs was removed, and the rapper’s career was largely doomed. Without full lung capacity, he simply can’t perform like he used to, but AI might just give him the perfect solution to his problems.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Can AI help recreate Beanie Sigel’s voice?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.instagram.com/p/CtFgQPLrF1s/?hl=en</figure><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>AI is by no means a perfect tool, but it’s proven to be broadly versatile. It’s on the rise on apps like TikTok and Twitter (now rebranded as X) and some people are even using it to update headshots for sites like LinkedIn. We’ve barely scratched the surface of all the technology is capable of, and Sigel’s aims to use AI in music have the potential to set a new precedent.</p><p data-characters=557 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>If it works, that is. There’s no guarantee that his venture into AI will deliver the results Sigel is looking for, but there is evidence to support his theory about the technology’s potential. We already use AI tools in music, by feeding existing songs, lyrics, and tones into an AI tool and allowing it to mix, match, and mess with the wealth of information to create something new. Sigel aims to do just this — flooding an AI tool with his previous music — in hopes of producing an AI support system that replicates his pre-accident voice.</p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=false>Since everything Sigel aims to feed into the AI is his own work, the issue of creative license and AIs stealing jobs is lessened. In this case, Sigel really has no alternative. No surgery is going to give him that portion of lung back, and without it, he’ll never return to his former glory. But by incorporating AI into his upcoming work, he may be able to meld his current tones with his old ones for a nice hybrid that combines the style everyone loves with something brand new.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjK2mZpqVlruqsYysoKCdnKh6t7vInJxmmZ6ZeqStzWaYomWimrCzscCtnGahpGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ron-howards-wife-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Ron Howard Dating Ron Howard's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sam-holland-tom-hollands-brother-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sam Holland | Tom Hollands Brother | Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-michelle-obama-file-for-divorce.html>Barack and Michelle Obama's Marriage Is Being Dragged Through the Mud, and We Won't Allow It!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ella-anderson-net-worth-142333.html>Ella Anderson Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./43369-kush-kelz-illest-nigga-ever-feat-ab-soul-new-song.html>Illest N*gga Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-lennon-net-worth-156902.html>John Lennon Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./justin-roilands-net-worth-explained-how-much-roiland-made-from-rick-and-morty-and-more.html>Justin Roilands net worth explained: How much Roiland made from Rick and Morty and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapJolt.
