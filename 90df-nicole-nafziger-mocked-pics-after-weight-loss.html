Her Instagram features some stinging comments from critics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SCREEN-RANT-IMAGE-3-6.jpg><p>Even weight loss didn’t help <a href=#><strong>90 Day Fiancé</strong></a> star Nicole Nafziger to earn the fan vote, amid her troubled relationship with Azan Tefou. Fans best remember <a href=#>Nicole for her debut in 90DF</a> season 4, with her Moroccan beau. She is a single mother from Florida, who met Azan online. Then, she flew to his country to meet him in person, leaving her toddler daughter behind. Fans noticed that Azan made his lack of interest in Nicole quite clear. In fact, on the show, the personal trainer openly mocked her weight, and said that he was only "55%" attracted to her.</p><p>Azan constantly pushed Nicole to get fit, by calling her lazy. He attempts to drag her to the gym, and fat-shaming in general, seemingly made her want to lose weight. In November 2018, she posted one of her first-ever weight loss updates on Instagram. As per Nicole, she had lost 14 pounds in 18 days. She admitted that it felt good to see the number on the scale decreasing. She did consider herself overweight, and <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé's Nicole’s biggest fear</a> was that she would somehow reach 300 pounds. She never wanted to hit that number, and decided that it was high time that she started focusing on her health.</p><p>The heaviest weight that Nicole has ever been at is 296 pounds. At that point, Nicole knew that she was ready for a change. She began her weight loss journey with great dedication, calling it the best decision she’d ever made, with regard to improving her health. While Nicole kept fans updated with regular Instagram posts, many noted that they could see hardly any difference in the way that she looked, before and after weight loss. They mocked her appearance, and trashed her poor life choices.</p><h2 id=90df-39-s-nicole-claps-back-at-a-body-shamer>90DF's Nicole Claps Back At A Body-Shamer</h2><p>“Why the wide face?” a rude commentator asked <a href=#>Nicole, referring to her Instagram photo</a> from September 2020, which has over 20,000 likes. In her photo, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole</a> wore a charcoal t-shirt with dark jeans, and posed in front of the mirror for a selfie. “Was loving myself in this outfit the other day, chubbiness and all,” was Nicole’s caption, with the hashtag, “#selflove.” Some fans thought that Nicole’s post was motivating, as they wrote, “you’ve lost a lot of weight” and called her, “gorgeous.” However, there were several other negative comments that made fun of her. “How about being a good mother to your little girl? Choosing a looser instead of your child,” said one TLC viewer.</p><h2 id=90df-39-s-nicole-flaunts-bare-faced-selfie-after-slimming-down>90DF's Nicole Flaunts Bare-Faced Selfie After Slimming Down</h2><p>The confidence that <a href=#>losing weight gave Nicole</a> inspired her to post more of her natural selfies on Instagram. Her weight loss is evident in her face in this post from August 2020, where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole</a> wears no makeup. While sitting in her car, she captioned her photo with, “Going to pamper myself today,” and called it self-care. “You are one of the rare humans who look super cute without makeup!” wrote a fan. Meanwhile, as expected, many others reached out to Nicole to ask her to “lose weight,” saying that getting slimmer would be better self-care. Someone even asked Nicole to “drink” her greens “normally,” if she didn’t like veggies, instead of scooping “powder” in her mouth.</p><h2 id=90df-39-s-nicole-slammed-for-shilling-weight-loss-hacks>90DF's Nicole Slammed For Shilling Weight Loss Hacks</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Nicole-Nafziger-Confirmed-Not-Together-Breakup-Azan-In-90-Day-Fiance-2.jpg><p>The powder in question is a weight loss supplement that <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé celeb Nicole</a> is infamous for promoting on her Instagram, along with her usual clickbait tactics, which have now ceased. One such post, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole</a> later deleted, is from November 2019, and shows her promoting “shots” that apparently made it easy for her to “stay consistent with health kicks.”</p><p>She had taken two photos in the same outfit, from different angles, perhaps to make them look like before-and-after weight loss pics. Fans advised others to avoid buying the “worthless supplements” that reality TV people like Nicole hawk on IG. “All it does is upset fans and they stop following there is no easy quick way,” reads one of the comments. One <strong>90 Day Fiancé</strong> fan claimed to have gotten a “bad reaction” from using the product. Another simply mocked <a href=#>reality TV star Nicole</a> by adding, “why would anyone buy this if it's not working for you?”</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Nafziger</a>/Instagram, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Nafziger</a>/Instagram</p>Related Topics About The Author<h3 class=section-title>Recommended Articles</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirk6eyprrRmqWtZpOkunCFj52dZqaZmLytsYynmJ%2BymZyys3nMqJqknZRivaqv0maYn6yVp3q4scign61lnKTAtHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./272419-nicki-minaj-asks-to-see-doja-cats-boobs-after-going-1-news.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nicki Minaj Asks To See Doja Cat's Boobs After Going #1</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./8-facts-you-didnt-know-about-the-jessica-chambers-murder-case.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>8 facts you didnt know about the Jessica Chambers murder case</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-michelle-obama-file-for-divorce.html>Barack and Michelle Obama's Marriage Is Being Dragged Through the Mud, and We Won't Allow It!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ella-anderson-net-worth-142333.html>Ella Anderson Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./43369-kush-kelz-illest-nigga-ever-feat-ab-soul-new-song.html>Illest N*gga Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-lennon-net-worth-156902.html>John Lennon Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./justin-roilands-net-worth-explained-how-much-roiland-made-from-rick-and-morty-and-more.html>Justin Roilands net worth explained: How much Roiland made from Rick and Morty and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapJolt.
