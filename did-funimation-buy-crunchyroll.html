Despite this fact, Funimation’s been around for longer, bolstered by the Dragon Ball franchise to create Funimation films and, eventually, launch the Funimation streaming service.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>In the years since Funimation put out its service, it and Crunchyroll have been stark competitors. Most anime fans have to choose one or the other — damn those subscription costs — but the choice just got quite a bit easier, thanks to a merger that’s been in the works since 2021.</p><h2 id=h-did-funimation-and-crunchyroll-merge data-injectable=false>Did Funimation and Crunchyroll merge?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/JayWood2010/status/1755459123934568847</figure><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Crunchyroll subscribers recently saw a change in price, which sparked concerns over the company’s future. Many people, aware of but uninformed about the Sony merger, assumed it was because Funimation acquired Crunchyroll, but its actually close to the opposite.</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=true>To be clear, neither Crunchyroll nor Funimation outright purchased one another, but Sony’s spending spree has seen the two companies begin to merge. Sony purchased a majority stake in Funimation back in 2017, and, right around a half-decade later, set its sights on Crunchyroll. Sony officially managed to purchase Crunchyroll in 2021, and since then the company’s been hard at work <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">merging the two anime giants</a>.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>The process <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">started in March of 2022</a>, and its been ongoing ever since. The process of combining the two anime streamers will be complete by summer of 2024, but it comes with a catch — the Funimation app is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">set to shut down completely</a> on April 2 of this year. With the vast majority of content still-accessible through the freshly merged Crunchyroll, that’s not really an issue —&nbsp;but the loss of digital purchases is.</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>Former Funimation subscribers recently learned that, when that April 2 shutdown occurs, they’ll lose access to any digital copies they may have purchased through the app. In a statement, Crunchyroll announced the change in a statement, noting that “Crunchyroll does not currently support Funimation Digital copies, which means that access to previously available digital copies will not be supported.”</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Subscribers will still have access to their watch history and Funimation queues to enjoy, as their former Funimation account is merged with their new Crunchyroll account. But with the loss of digital purchases, paired with a major shift in subscription cost, not everyone is looking forward to April.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is there a Crunchyroll price increase?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Crunchyroll.jpg><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>Alongside the official merging of Crunchyroll and Funimations anime libraries, Crunchyroll announced a major pricing change. The cost of a Crunchyroll subscription is set to nearly double starting early next year, but with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">no real competition on the market</a>, subscribers won’t have many options outside of the pricey new plan.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=691 data-injectable=true>In the end, its up to viewers whether or not they’ll pay the price, but Crunchyroll’s not likely to back down on this one. Sony’s created a bit of an anime monopoly with its merging of Crunchyroll and Funimation, and — state-side, at least — viewers aren’t left with enough alternate options to turn their noses up at the new cost.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>If you’re a frequent anime watcher, the new cost is likely reasonable, but for anyone who only enjoys the occasional anime a Crunchyroll subscription will likely be out of the question starting on Jan. 28, 2025. That’s when the price of subscribing will rise from the current $54.95 per year to the new cost — a whopping $99.99 per year, nearly double what people are paying in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6doJ1llqq7qrnAraCopl2Xwrp5wqusp5uYrr%2BwuMto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jalen-carter-height-how-tall-is-jalen-carter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jalen Carter Height: How Tall Is Jalen Carter?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./darianka-sanchez.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Darianka Snchez (Model) Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Career, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-michelle-obama-file-for-divorce.html>Barack and Michelle Obama's Marriage Is Being Dragged Through the Mud, and We Won't Allow It!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ella-anderson-net-worth-142333.html>Ella Anderson Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./43369-kush-kelz-illest-nigga-ever-feat-ab-soul-new-song.html>Illest N*gga Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-lennon-net-worth-156902.html>John Lennon Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./justin-roilands-net-worth-explained-how-much-roiland-made-from-rick-and-morty-and-more.html>Justin Roilands net worth explained: How much Roiland made from Rick and Morty and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapJolt.
