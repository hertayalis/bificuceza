To begin, she is the daughter of a well-known American football coach, Kyle Shanahan, the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.</h3><h2>Stella Shanahan’s net worth</h2><p>Stella is currently studying and is too young to work, so it is safe to assume she does not have any wealth of her own. But she doesn’t have to because her father, Kyle Shanahan, is a well-known NFL player.</p><p>As the head coach of the San Francisco 49ers, one of the most valuable teams in the NFL, he has a net worth of <strong>$5 million</strong>. The former offensive coordinator also owns a multimillion-dollar home in California.</p><h2>Personal Life of Stella Shanahan</h2><p>Stella is only twelve years old, so it is reasonable to assume that she is currently enrolled in school. She lives a low-key life, in contrast to her celebrity father, who is constantly surrounded by the media.</p><p>She is also not on social media because she is too young to have one. Her father and mother aren’t on social media either.</p><p>Shanahan is currently spending time with her parents, Mandy and Kyle Shanahan, who have been married for fifteen years. She is the tyrant who prefers to spend time with her siblings Carter and Lexi Louise.</p><p>Stella is the well-known child of an extremely private but endearing couple who rarely speak openly about their personal lives. According to Stella’s social media profile, she is quite different from her siblings and parents, who lead quiet lives. Stella is down-to-earth and willing to help others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Stella-Shanahan-2-300x231.jpg><h2>Stella’s Parents: How Did They Meet? What About Her Brothers and Sisters?</h2><p>Stella’s parents, Kyle and Mandy Shanahan met when they were both students at Cherry Creek High School in Greenwood Village, Colorado.</p><p>The young lady’s parents dated for a short time before parting ways to attend college. However, when her mother was a student at the University of Colorado, the two reconnected and a new love story began to blossom between them.</p><p>After many years of dating, the couple married on July 5, 2005. Stella was born two years after their marriage.</p><p>Stella’s siblings, including brother Carter Shanahan, arrived about two years later, and Mady gave birth to her sister Lexi Louise Shanahan on October 22, 2012.</p><p>Stella has a private life with her family, but there is no doubt that she lives a happy and peaceful life with her siblings and parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Stella-Shanahan-273x300.jpg><h2>Stella Shanahan Interesting Facts</h2><ul><li>Stella Shanahan was born in the city of Houston, Texas.</li><li>Mike Shanahan, a former American coach, and Peggy Shanahan are her grandparents.</li><li>Her mother, Mandy, studied English Literature at the University of Colorado.</li><li>Her parents named her younger brother Carter after Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., aka Lil Wayne, her father’s favorite rapper.</li><li>Chris Simms, a former Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback, is close friends with her father.</li></ul><h2>Quick facts:</h2><table id=factsDetails class="highlight sticky"><tbody><tr><th><span class="heading age" style=font-weight:400>Age :</span></th><td><span class=value>14 years old</span></td></tr><tr><th><span class="heading familyName" style=font-weight:400>Family Name :</span></th><td><span class=value>Shanahan</span></td></tr><tr><th><span class="heading birthPlace" style=font-weight:400>Birth Country :</span></th><td><a title="United States" href=# rel="follow nofollow"><span style=color:#333>United States</span></a></td></tr><tr><th><span class="heading height" style=font-weight:400>Height :</span></th><td><span class=value><a href=# rel=nofollow>4 Feet 1 inch</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>You may also like: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Sarah Ward</a>, <a href=# rel=bookmark>Marcel Young</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKukmrmtrYysn5qmkZ2ur3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-ezra-koenig-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Ezra Koenig?
