In a new interview with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People</a>, Ferrera shouted out fellow actress <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Kerry Washington</a>, who she says helped her through navigating the complicated world of heading back to work after having a baby. Ferrera, who starred in last year's blockbuster hit&nbsp;Barbie, shares a 5-year-old son named Sebastian and a 3-year-old daughter named Lucia Marisol with her husband, Ryan Piers Williams. During her chat, Ferrera explained that she went back to work on the set of her NBC comedy&nbsp;Superstore&nbsp;just months after Sebastian arrived.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I first had my first child, my son, I went back to shoot on&nbsp;Superstore&nbsp;when he was 10 weeks old,” Ferrera started. She went on to say that Washington was a huge source of support, since she also had children while working on her show. So, Ferrera leaned on her for advice — and Washington was happy to help.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was so lucky to have&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Kerry Washington</a>&nbsp;as a friend, who had two of her babies while she was on&nbsp;Scandal. I remember asking her, 'How do you do it? How are you on a TV show and have a newborn baby? What am I going to do?'" Ferrera continued. "And she gave me the most detailed instructions of every single thing that I was going to do to make my life easier, down to the exact Pack ‘n Play for my trailer.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Washington's advice included everything and anything Ferrera needed — and more. Ferrera explained that the actress behind Olivia Pope was candid about sharing even the tiniest details, including “her pumping and breastfeeding schedule on set and exactly what bra she bought to get for wardrobe. And it was like she just saved me."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think all the time about how many tears and how much energy and how much money and how much trial and error she saved me by just telling me what she learned having done the same thing in the same position. And countless times, just in the almost six years that I've been a mom, it's other moms and other women who have saved me and kept me going and kept me feeling like I can do this," Ferrera finished.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She also spoke about her husband and how he supports her both at home with their children and professionally. Plus, she adds, the sentiment goes both ways.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He is incredibly present and hands-on as a father, but he also just really cares about my dreams,” she noted. “He really wants me to be what I want to be in the world. And so he thinks of my dreams as his own. I think of his dreams as my responsibility, too.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>More in Celeb News</span></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wKacq6GTlnqnsdGrnKuZXaCys77YZq6aq5ieu6jAzqdkoZ2cpbavs4yhnKtloKTAtbzAq6uupV2nsrXB0adkraddrLyzt4xxa2tqY2aF</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-did-music-legend-ray-charles-die-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Did Music Legend Ray Charles Die?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tgziam-htm.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ti Taylor - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-michelle-obama-file-for-divorce.html>Barack and Michelle Obama's Marriage Is Being Dragged Through the Mud, and We Won't Allow It!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ella-anderson-net-worth-142333.html>Ella Anderson Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./43369-kush-kelz-illest-nigga-ever-feat-ab-soul-new-song.html>Illest N*gga Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-lennon-net-worth-156902.html>John Lennon Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./justin-roilands-net-worth-explained-how-much-roiland-made-from-rick-and-morty-and-more.html>Justin Roilands net worth explained: How much Roiland made from Rick and Morty and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapJolt.
