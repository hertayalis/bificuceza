The <a href=#>HGTV</a> show stars married couple Ben and Cristi Dozier as they create and customize homes for clients in a particular area.</p><p>But where is the show filmed? This duo loves their home so much that they named their kids after towns in their home state.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is 'Building Roots' filmed?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HGTV</a>, Building Roots is filmed in Pagosa Springs, Colo. The area is a source of inspiration for Ben and Cristi's work at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Root Design Company</a>. Although the two are originally from Texas, they have built a new life in the Centennial State. Back in 2004, they moved and never seemed to look back.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Now, the family lives in a 100-year-old Victorian home, and the couple's business has its own workspace on the same property.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Ben and Cristi Dozier's kids?</h2><p>A love for Colorado runs deep for Ben and Cristi. So much so, in fact, that they named some of their kids after locations in the state. The couple share four children: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adelyn</a>, Gunnison, Creede, and South.</p><p>"Cristi named Adelyn, which is a beautiful name," Ben told HGTV. "And I named a couple of our kids after towns in Colorado that I'd lived in or had significant value to us."</p><p>Gunnison and Creede are named after areas in the state, although Creede is actually a nickname (his real name is Benjamin).</p><p>South is also a locational nickname for their youngest (his real name is Christopher).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Based on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">family's Instagram posts</a>, it's clear that each of them shares a love of the outdoors. But despite this, their home designs don't always reflect this. Ben told HGTV about how he prides himself on how the Doziers' business is about their clients, not them and what they like.</p><p>"Once we figure out what that story is … it gives us direction. It gives us purpose. It gives us a mission and a vision and that translates into sketches and design," Ben said.</p><p>Cristi added that Building Roots is about just that. "It's the idea that people are building so much more than a home. They are putting their roots down," she said. "They're wanting this to grow to be more than just a house project,"</p><p>You can watch Building Roots on HGTV on Sundays at 9 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmoKxlkqq2rbDIp55mqp%2BkwbR5xaKjpp2U</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-to-watch-love-island-reunion-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where to watch Love Island reunion 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./laura-coover-net-worth-67313.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Laura Coover Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-michelle-obama-file-for-divorce.html>Barack and Michelle Obama's Marriage Is Being Dragged Through the Mud, and We Won't Allow It!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ella-anderson-net-worth-142333.html>Ella Anderson Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./43369-kush-kelz-illest-nigga-ever-feat-ab-soul-new-song.html>Illest N*gga Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-lennon-net-worth-156902.html>John Lennon Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./justin-roilands-net-worth-explained-how-much-roiland-made-from-rick-and-morty-and-more.html>Justin Roilands net worth explained: How much Roiland made from Rick and Morty and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapJolt.
