Cam’ron’s expanding the Flee Farm brand with endeavors in cannabis and his all-natural male supplement, <a href=# rel>Pink Horse Power</a>. Meanwhile, Jim Jones has been delivering some of the best music in his career over the past few years with projects like El Chapo, Wasted Talent, and <a href=# rel>Back In My Prime</a> with Hitmaka which he released over this weekend.</p><p>Back In My Prime not only showcases Jim Jones’ versatility, especially when it comes to crafting hits, but he also dives into some personal matters. On “Status Update,” for example, he sheds light on some issues weighing on him including his friendship with Cam’ron. Though the two recently appeared together at <a href=# rel>Drake’s Apollo Theatre show</a> with the rest of <a href=# class=text-word rel>Dipset</a>, Jones admitted that they aren’t seeing “eye to eye” lately. “And it’s hard for me & Cam to see eye-to-eye/ I love him, I still love him but when I see him it’s like hi & bye,” he raps. “It’s kinda crazy, I thought it was ride or die.”</p><span><h2 id=h-jim-jones-cam-ron-s-fractured-relationship>Jim Jones & Cam’ron’s Fractured Relationship</h2></span><p>Though Jim Jones and Cam’ron’s relationship hasn’t deteriorated completely, as it once was, he said during an interview in Feb. 2022 that he and Cam’ron <a href=# rel>hadn’t talked or seen each other since Verzuz in August 2021</a>. He didn’t say that there were any issues. However, he explained that he had to offer Cam his own earnings from Verzuz to get him to agree to appear at the face-off against <a href=# class=text-word rel>The Lox</a>. “Cam don’t care about too much, he makes money and that’s what he cares about,” Jones admitted.</p><p>However, years prior, Cam’ron said that Dipset was officially over in the midst of his feud with Jim Jones. The “We Fly High” rapper appeared on Funk Flex where he shed tears when asked about the sacrifices he made for Cam’ron and Dipset. Cam later addressed his comments and downplayed Jim’s overall feelings. Eventually, they buried the hatchet to reunite as Dipset before unveiling their 2018 EP, Diplomatic Ties. Still, the two recently worked together on Cam’ron’s U Wasn’t There EP on the single, “Think Boy” alongside <a href=# class=text-word rel>Styles P</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaYJ4fJdmoaKlXZ%2B8r7HSZqqasaNitaZ5wpqkq6eeYrGwutNmqp6dXZrGpnnTqGSesZU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lady-gaga.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lady Gaga: Latest News and Photos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-fix-retaining-wall-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How much does it cost to fix retaining wall?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-michelle-obama-file-for-divorce.html>Barack and Michelle Obama's Marriage Is Being Dragged Through the Mud, and We Won't Allow It!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ella-anderson-net-worth-142333.html>Ella Anderson Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./43369-kush-kelz-illest-nigga-ever-feat-ab-soul-new-song.html>Illest N*gga Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-lennon-net-worth-156902.html>John Lennon Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./justin-roilands-net-worth-explained-how-much-roiland-made-from-rick-and-morty-and-more.html>Justin Roilands net worth explained: How much Roiland made from Rick and Morty and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapJolt.
