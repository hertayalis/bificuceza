Ronson also has three half-siblings from her father’s marriage to Michele First, as well as two stepbrothers from Jones’ earlier relationships.</p><p>She is the niece of Gerald Ronson, a property magnate who was convicted of fraud, fraudulent accounting, and theft in 1990 for his role in the Guinness share-trading scam. Samantha attended Manhattan’s Chapin School before enrolling at New York University, where she studied philosophy and creative writing.</p><p>Samantha was the first rock musician to sign with the hip-hop company Roc-A-Fella Records, but the album she created and recorded there was never released.

She began to build a reputation for herself and finally began DJing full-time.</p><p>Samantha has performed as a DJ at events including the Super Bowl, the Sundance Film Festival, MTV’s New Year’s Eve show, the American Music Awards, and the Pan American Games.
