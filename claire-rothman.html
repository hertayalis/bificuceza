On one side, she was handling her house bills and on the other side, she was handling the thousands of data for the electric expenses in the Spectrum. The astonishing thing was not that she was performing all these roles but it was that she had a great hand in the business of her ex-husband that helped her to grow in her later life.</p><h3>Claire Rothman Net Worth</h3><p>Claire Rothman produces an estimated net worth of around $1.5 million because of her former collaborations with the companies and the associations.
