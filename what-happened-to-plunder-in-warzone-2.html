The game’s developers have said that they were only turned off temporarily and will be back soon. But they haven’t said when exactly the two modes will be back. Based on rumors, it seems likely that they will come back with the next playlist update or after the Operation Siege Event is over.</p><p>Warzone 2 has a special game mode called “Plunder.” Plunder is very different from Resurgence and Battle Royale, where the last person or team standing wins.</p><p>The winner is only chosen by one factor: which team gets $1 million in cash first. Because the game was easy to play, it gained a lot of fans over time.</p><p>Still, the mode being taken away has made a lot of people unhappy. In this piece, we’ll talk more about when it might come back, why it was taken away, and other things.</p><h2>Why Was Plunder Deleted From WarZone?</h2><p>No one knows for sure why Plunder was taken out of Warzone. Call of Duty tweeted that the mode was being taken away because they were looking into a problem, but they didn’t say what the problem was. Even the official Trello board that keeps track of different problems doesn’t talk about the exact reason.</p><p>Speculations are, of course, everywhere. The community says that something had to be done about how XP is earned. The game mode would give a lot of XP to players, which helps them level up. But because it was so profitable, players could take advantage of it and get a lot of experience points with little work.</p><p><img alt="What Happened to Plunder in Warzone 2.0?" width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/1-64.jpg></p><p>Still, it’s important to note that these are just rumors, and the creators haven’t said anything for sure.</p><p>The people who made it haven’t said anything about when it will come back. But, as we’ve already said, it’s likely to come back with the next Playlist update, which is due on August 16, 2023. It’s also possible that the modes will be available after the Shadow Siege Modern Warfare 3 reveal event is over.</p><p>This is all you need to know about why Plunder and Lockdown are being taken away and when they are likely to be back. People in the community are surprised that the mode was taken away without a good reason.</p><p>Also, fans who are looking forward to the MW3 reveal event should watch Warzone 2 on August 17, 2023, to get a sneak peek at the future release.</p><p>Season 5 of Warzone 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 are now available. The update is available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PCs through Battle.net and Steam.</p><p>Read More:</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The 10 Most Popular Guns in Warzone 2: Which Ones Should You Choose?</a></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Warzone 2 has temporarily removed Plunder and Lockdown game modes, which gained popularity in the game.
