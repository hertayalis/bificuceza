He taped a strip of rubber to the glass door and left behind a fire extinguisher.</p><p>A minute later, the Ring camera recorded a&nbsp;car bursting into flames&nbsp;in the background.</p><p>That’s shortly after he allegedly killed Hodgkin, with whom he shared a daughter. According to federal court filings, he had been wanted on allegations that he’d raped Hodgkin at the time of her shooting death.</p><p>He eluded authorities for the next 11 days. On May 20,&nbsp;a Pennsylvania couple was reported missing along with their car. South Caroline&nbsp;police found them safe two days later, along with a note from Burham to his father.</p><p>By May 23, after a couple and their dog spotted him trespassing near their shed, police&nbsp;captured him&nbsp;following a two-hour chase through the woods nearby.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Burham escaped jail after he was accused of kidnapping a couple. <span class=credit>Cattaraugus County Sheriff's Office</span></figure><p>“I’m not sorry for what I did, however I do feel terrible about the children,” the note read, according to court filings.</p><p>He wrote that he had “quit drinking” on May 10 and apologized “for all the problems” he caused his family.</p><p>Burham has been a heavy drinker for years, according to a source who knows him well and asked to remain anonymous, citing safety concerns as the murder suspect remains at large.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Kala Hodgkin was allegedly gunned down by Burham in May. <span class=credit>Kala Hodgkin/Facebook</span></figure><p>“He drank a lot,” the source said. “From the time he woke up until he fell asleep, he had to have a beer in his hand. He also used cocaine over the last three or so years.”</p><p>Pennsylvania State Police, who are spearheading the manhunt, say Burham should be considered armed and dangerous.</p><p>The former&nbsp;Army reservist&nbsp;is believed to be a skilled survivalist and may be receiving aid while on the run, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens told reporters Monday.</p><p>“We do believe that he is getting some assistance,” Bivens revealed during his remarks Monday afternoon. “We are prepared to prosecute anyone who does offer him assistance.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Footage from a Ring doorbell camera shows Burham on a woman’s porch before ‘allegedly torching her car in the driveway.’ <span class=credit>Fox News</span></figure><p>Police believe he is still in Warren County or one of its surrounding areas, and multiple witnesses have been relocated for their safety pending his capture, according to authorities.</p><p>Police have been on his trail since early Friday and previously told Fox News that they’d uncovered a series of possible campsites in the area and did not believe the suspect had traveled far.</p><p>The source, however, said while Burham does have significant survival skills, he would likely have trouble feeding himself over a sustained period.</p><p>“At some point we will force him to make a mistake, and when he does, we will use that to our advantage,” Bivens said.&nbsp;</p><p>U.S. Marshals joined the manhunt Saturday, announcing a reward of up to $9,500 for information leading to his capture.</p><p>The manhunt&nbsp;entered its fifth day Tuesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bmamlfp7avs4yvoJ2dn2LAqbvWrGSmoZOdrqa4jJusq6CRonqjwdGnoKefXZius3nOp2Smp6Kjtq%2BzjKidZqORoa5utM6dnqShnmK6tr7Dnqlo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-young-and-the-restless-melissa-claire-egan-opens-up-about-her-ivf-journey-to-general-hospitals-maurice-benard.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Young And The Restless' Melissa Claire Egan Opens Up About Her IVF Journey To Maurice Benard</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-tracey-car-accident.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paul Tracey Car Accident: Waltham MA police officer, Waltham police officer, utility worker killed o</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./did-michelle-obama-file-for-divorce.html>Barack and Michelle Obama's Marriage Is Being Dragged Through the Mud, and We Won't Allow It!</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ella-anderson-net-worth-142333.html>Ella Anderson Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./43369-kush-kelz-illest-nigga-ever-feat-ab-soul-new-song.html>Illest N*gga Ever</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./john-lennon-net-worth-156902.html>John Lennon Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./justin-roilands-net-worth-explained-how-much-roiland-made-from-rick-and-morty-and-more.html>Justin Roilands net worth explained: How much Roiland made from Rick and Morty and more</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SnapJolt.
