I did not know he has knee surgery</p><p>yes…so perhaps pre surgery he was in pain<br>and maybe since he would be out and having therapy for a while, I think they might have taped several scenes with him to be aired until he can return</p><p>Right about the surgery and this website had a piece about him overdoing his physical therapy many weeks later. And that caused an injury and a setback to healing.</p><p>Have you noticed, also, the whenever he speaks, he’s looking down. Who else thinks he’s reading his lines?</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I will pay more attention to that in the future. I love the character and the actor who plays Victor Newman and will be very sad if and when the character/actor leaves the show.</p><p>Yes he had knee replacement but I’m sure he also underwent rehab along with physical therapy days after that surgery. People much older than EB, that are not in the great physical condition that EB boasts of, have had the exact surgery & are encouraged to walk as tolerated and discouraged from sitting too much.<br>At this stage he should be very capable of standing and walking with no problems.</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>SoPea</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>February 9, 2023, 6:47pm <span itemprop=position>9</span></span><p>I wish good health and a speedy recovery to EB. As far as Victor, the character is not as important as he once was. Time to focus on the next generations.
