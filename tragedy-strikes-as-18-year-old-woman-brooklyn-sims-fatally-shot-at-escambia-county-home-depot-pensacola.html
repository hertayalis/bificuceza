The victim, identified as Brooklyn Sims, was tragically shot and killed on Friday while she was at work as a contracted inventory employee at the Home Depot located on Davis Highway.</p><p>Brooklyn, a mother to a 2-year-old girl, was well-liked by friends and coworkers. The community is mourning the loss of this young life that was filled with promise and potential.</p><p></p><p>The alleged perpetrator, Keith Agee, 20, has been taken into custody for the murder.

The motive behind the shooting remains under investigation.</p><p>Disturbing text messages exchanged between Keith Agee and his mother, Sheila Agee, have come to light. The messages suggest a sinister plot leading up to the fatal shooting. According to authorities, Sheila Agee is now facing charges as an accessory to first-degree murder for her alleged role in coordinating the crime.</p><p><strong>Text Messages between Keith Agee and Sheila Agee:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Keith</strong>: “Shi ain’t do nun but cost me money and gave me a ******* I’m fin just shoot her Ik I hate that for [daughter] buh like I said I can’t take it idgaf Nomo.”</li><li><strong>Sheila:</strong>&nbsp;“Ok.”</li><li><strong>Sheila</strong>: “Ok I’ll call you and tell you mf if you want to go to jail I’ll tell you when we get close but if you don’t come kill her you a mf b**ch.”</li><li><strong>Sheila</strong>: “Don’t call nanny and tell her she will try and talk you out of it.”</li><li><strong>Keith</strong>: “Ian even gon tell her y I left.

Surveillance footage captured the chilling moments as the incident unfolded. Agee was later arrested after he called 911 from a nearby location and surrendered to the police.</p><p>The revelation of these text messages adds a disturbing layer to this tragedy, shedding light on the alleged planning and involvement of Agee’s mother. The details contained within the messages depict a chilling intent to harm Sims.</p><p>Friends and community members are coming together to remember Brooklyn Sims and offer their support to her family. A balloon release in her honor is scheduled for Monday evening at Davis Park in Citronelle, Alabama. As the investigation continues, the community seeks answers and justice for the young life taken far too soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kwbOtxp6bsmWjqb%2Bqt8SsZJqrXWaFbsXEmqlmp5yZeri7zJqlZpqipLysuNinZKyhnah6p63TmqOlsV2otbDAjJqrZp2jmK6ursiaZJynpaPBunnHqKSeZZSavbDAjKmcp6uRmLytrY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-my-unorthodox-life-a-true-story-fans-hope-show-is-scripted-for-julias-sake.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is My Unorthodox Life a true story?
